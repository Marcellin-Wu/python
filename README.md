# 1) Black-Scholes Pricing Model

Python implementation of the Black-Scholes model for European options.

## What this project shows
- Option pricing (Call / Put)
- Greeks computation with plots as a function of spot price and maturity

# 2) Monte Carlo Option Pricing

Monte Carlo simulation approach for pricing European call option.

👉 Main file: [Monte Carlo.ipynb](https://github.com/Marcellin-Wu/python/blob/main/Monte%20Carlo%20Options%20Pricing.ipynb)

## What this project shows
- Asset price simulation 
- Call option pricing via Monte Carlo methods
- Convergence and numerical accuracy illustrated through plots

# 3) Volatility Smile Analysis

Empirical analysis of the implied volatility smile observed in option markets.

👉 Main file: [Volatility Smile.ipynb](https://github.com/Marcellin-Wu/python/blob/main/Volatility%20smile.ipynb)

## What this project shows
- Implied volatility computation
- Volatility smile plots across different strike prices
- Limitations of the Black–Scholes model

# 4) Stylized Facts & Regression Analysis

Statistical analysis of financial returns and regression-based modeling.

👉 Main file: [Stylized Facts & Regression.ipynb](https://github.com/Marcellin-Wu/python/blob/main/Stylized%20Facts%20%2B%20Regression.ipynb)

## What this project shows
- Stylized facts of asset returns (fat tails, excess kurtosis, skewness, volatility clustering, leverage effect, absence of linear autocorrelation)
- Regression analysis (CAPM, FAMA-FRENCH model)
